# Lol-Login
Auto connect to any of Your league of legends accounts with one click .
The UI contains a first page where you can add your accounts to the "Lol Login" .
Then , easily connect to them with the 4 accounts buttons .
The "Clear accounts" button is also there if you wanna reset the accounts or if you entered the wrond "id" or "password" .
NOTE : the program wont work if you dont change the directory inside the code to the "league client location" (am working on making a button to directly change it from the interface) .
NOTE : also the the program will run the league client by him self so make sure to not have the client already open (even tho it should normaly not affect anything 
but just to be sure ) .
UPDATE : just added a directory button to select the league client file (note that it should look like this " C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends" ) , also added a button to clear the directory and pick it again (in the case of failing to choose the right file) .
REQUIREMENTS : OS (pip install os-sys) , Subprocess (pip install subprocess.run) , pynput (pip install pynput) , DearPyGUI (pip install dearpygui) .
